ðŸš€ Fellowship Programme - First Task

To kick things off, here's your first task:

Create a GitHub Account (if you donâ€™t already have one):
Go to GitHub and sign up for an account.
Create a Public Repository
Once youâ€™ve signed up, create a public repository with the following name format:
"Your Name-Buildables-Fellowship-2025" (replace "Your Name" with your actual name).
Upload Your Assignments:
All your weekly assignments need to be uploaded to this repository. Iâ€™ll check them there, so itâ€™s important to keep everything updated!

Google Sheets:
After creating your repo, share the link to your GitHub repo with me in the attached Google Sheets. This will allow me to track your progress and give you feedback.

Important: Iâ€™ll also leave my remarks and feedback on the Google Sheets, so keep an eye on it for suggestions and areas to improve.
