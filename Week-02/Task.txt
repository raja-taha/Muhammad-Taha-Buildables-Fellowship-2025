Week 2: Data Preprocessing Techniques & Feature Transformation

Importance of Clean Data in Model Performance
Data Cleaning: Handling Missing Values and Outliers
Normalization & Standardization Techniques: Min-Max Scaling & Z-Score Standardization
Data Transformation: Log and Box-Cox Transformations
Handling Categorical Data: One-Hot Encoding & Label Encoding
Feature Scaling: The Role of Scaling in KNN, SVM, and Other Algorithms
Advanced Imputation Techniques for Missing Data
Dealing with Outliers: Detection and Handling Methods
Feature Engineering: Creating and Selecting the Best Features
Target Encoding for Categorical Variables
Dealing with Imbalanced Datasets: Resampling Techniques

learn and understand these concepts both theoretically and practically then implement these techniques on assignment 1 and retrain your models and compare the evaluation metrics for before these techniques and after.
